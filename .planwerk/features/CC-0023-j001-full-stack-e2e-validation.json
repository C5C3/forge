  "description": "Create an end-to-end integration test on kind: deploy full infrastructure stack (Phase 4), deploy both operators, apply ControlPlane CR, verify the c5c3-operator creates infrastructure CRs, waits for readiness, creates Keystone CR with correct projection. Verify the Keystone Operator deploys a fully functional Keystone service with Ready=True and the API responds on /v3. Validate the complete secret chain: OpenBao bootstrap writes secrets, ESO ExternalSecrets sync to K8s Secrets, operators consume Secrets for DB connection strings and admin password.",
